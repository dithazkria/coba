infections , commonly called , truely caused yeasts . the common organism responsible type infection candida albicans monilia actually yeast-like fungus . an infection caused organism called candidiasis . candidiasis rare occurance , like e. coli infection , requires host immune system severly depressed . candida frequently found skin mucous membranes normal healthy people rarely becomes problem unless predisposing factor present high blood glucose level ( diabetes ) oral course antibiotics used . in diabetics , secretions contain much higher amounts glucose . candida , unlike bacteria , limited 's food ( fuel ) selection . without glucose , grow , barely survives . if gets access lot glucose , blooms rides organisms living sinuses , gi tract vagina . in diabetics , skin lesions also foster good bloom site little buggers . the bloom usually minor irritant people people really develop bad inflammatory process mucus membrane skin bloom site . whether allergic like

opening day tokyo conference , g-7 conference . before i take questions , i 'd like defer colleague , review security assistance objectives . senior administration official : our major unfinished agenda russians counterparts ukraine , kazakhstan belarus area safe secure dismantlement nuclear arsenals territory terms start i start ii agreements . recently completed moscow three , i think , important agreements devote significant chunk nunn-lugar funding three important programs . the first program $ 130 million strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program . that submarines , icbm dismantlement bomber dismantlement -- $ 130 million . the second $ 75 million tranche funding construction facility store nuclear materials removed warheads dismantled . this essentially contribute overall design early phases construction storage facility . and finally , $ 10-million tranche money help establishment monitoring system nuclear materials withdrawn weapons system . so add $ 215-million total extant nunn-lugar assistance flowing -- $ 150 million overall safety improvements various kinds equipment safety measures working russians last couple years . so area going lot work russians ukrainians , kazhaks , belarussians . belarus , example , , last couple weeks , received $ 65 million fy'93 funds safety , security dismantlement programs belarussian territory . and wake ratification start i , agreement accede npt . so working hard parties lisbon protocols , continue work hard . and i look upon three recent agreements russia important step process . q the opic funds -- field kazhakstan -- conoco already signed deal kazhakstan . why feel necessary -- 's one , feel 's necessary ? senior administration official : it 's deal . chevron signed deal kazhakstan , tenges oil field . this new investment project . it 's polar lights oil development renovation project , 's announced today . so 's completely new . q can tell us 's involved ? senior administration official : yes . conoco , like american oil companies searching ways two things . one , prospect new oil siberia , west siberia ; two , try get business renovating oil wells renovating pipelines , oil gas , russia . the objective , obviously , take advantage natural resources russia , increase energy production , , turn , increase hard currency revenues , russia needs . so think deal , good development russia . the russians well , 's good american company . and american government played leading role pulling together credit facility opic loan guarantee . q so 's search also renovate fields already ? senior administration official : that 's right . q on point , american companies expect get administration support deals , go ex-im try get money $ 2 billion ? senior administration official : well , know , ex-im part u.s. government various parts u.s. government pushing , including state department white house deal consummated . and think . and arrive agreement april 14th , $ 2 billion financing available american companies sell equipment sell services . q that take rest deals wo n't -- wo n't support opic sort deals conoco ? senior administration official : there 's tremendous amount interest part american oil gas companies invest russia . we think ex-im oil gas facility , $ 2-billion facility , concluded , soak lot interest . but i think interest may even extend beyond . and , government respond . q what 's current year budget costs $ 2-billion agreement go forward ? and current year budget costs -- senior administration official : i 'll refer ex-im . i n't know details . q the concessional food sales -- current year costs , delayed years payments due ? senior administration official : the concessional food sales food progress , usda program . usda funds , n't need go back congress expend funds . there hit budget . i 'd refer usda omb details . q can talk democracy corps ? q private sector -- many folks going involved ? senior administration official : why n't i start democracy corps first . i think administration felt coming office literally thousands organization , private organizations united states one way another working goal trying achieve democratization russia , helping farmer-to-farmer basis . and literally 10 15 u.s. government agencies variety programs area . and administration felt -- president felt important try draw initiatives together one group give coherence efforts give impetus efforts . and presidential initiative . it headed ambassador tom simons soon take duties coordinator u.s. assistance former soviet union . and 're hopeful might use democracy corps draw upon resources government , resources american private sector schools communities across nation . q kind commitment yet , kind word yet fy'94 , new money needs appropriated besides $ 300 million president talked ? senior administration official : the administration requesting additional funds fy'94 $ 700 million . what president done weekend consult really intensively yesterday president yeltsin additional measures united states could take areas support reform . he 'll consulting congress . when returns washington , 'll consulting also ally governments , 'll make decision time . q two questions $ 700 billion agricultural money . first , i thought sort consensus russia need loans food . so decide way ? secondly , could explain -- agriculture stopped making loans food russia 's inability pay . how fit situation ? senior administration official : as know , united states long time major supplier grains food commodities , agricultural products russia . i think 1991 '92 extended -- little bit history -- $ 5.5 billion credits , credit guarantees , commodity credit corporation . that principal vehicle ensure sale american grain products . on december 1 last year , '92 , russian government stopped payments program . they arrears us program , therefore , law , united states continue program . and president , working secretary espy officials cabinet , looked ways could promote american grain sales . and i think two ways . we 've announced today $ 194 million grant food assistance food progress program . but sufficient authority spend $ 700 million grant food , looked concessional loan program . i think everybody agrees russia -- short-term loan program russia would make sense , long-term concessional loan program would . and program . it provide , final details worked , six seven-year grace period payments principal . and years seven 15 , life deal , provide concessional rates interest -- generally around three four percent . and believe russian government believes good deal avoid imperative early payments put years , also continue important grain relationship , important , 's important american farm community . q i gather say could make explicit -- russians ' failure pay interest ecc loan way affect kind loan going , right ? senior administration official : let explicit . we prevented law continuing commodity credit corporation short-term credit program russia 's arrearages united states . all know arrearages . they total , i think , around $ 640 million . usda give exact figure . so taken consideration wanting preserve american market share long-term grain relationship , wanting respond specific request russian government major food assistance , knowing could n't take grant programs n't sufficient authority , looked food progress , program 've used great effect parts world . and consulted russian government arrived solution . i think russians pleased provides food , also gives little bit relief short-term payments . q where funds actually come ? senior administration official : they come food progress program , program usda 's authority . usda authority spend funds . we need go back congress funds . and i want make general point : everything package , $ 1.6 billion package , comprises funds already allocated appropriated congress . the administration begin spend monies tomorrow . and 's important eyes expend funds year , meet commitments . and confident 'll able . q how arrive figure $ 700 million -- max program , actually range 0 -- senior administration official : there 's reason . the reason russian government told us 's amount grain needed harvest time . and idea would begin shipments probably $ 100 million per month harvest autumn , time russia wo n't require level food imports west . q i would imagine 's going considerable envy jealousy part republics size scope russia . have given consideration advancing negotiations kinds projects ukraine , georgia , republics ? senior administration official : yes , 're conscience fact also interest extending american support 11 countries former soviet union . we told , planned area technical assistance , grant technical assistance see , roughly 50 percent funding go russia roughly 50 percent countries . in area food sales , active ukraine , grant food assistance georgia armenia . we continue . and i think 's fair say summit go back look programs countries ensure adequate productive 're hard-hitting . q has anything happened summit lead american energy companies companies believe russia going user-friendly toward terms taxing , legalities , bureaucracy ? senior administration official : well , one primary objectives coming summit highlight , economic agenda , also trade investment . and i 'd like refer point i made beginning . we 're convinced talking problem -- problem support russia long-term -- 're convinced collection western governments financial resources next decade fuel continuation reform , private sector . we look society see tremendous capability resources oil gas sector . it good match russians need , financial investment existing oil gas wells pipeline new technology new capital finance new production . that 's russian government told us wants , 's made major emphasis . that 's trade investment prominent issue first day talks , fact , figured prominently last night meeting president yeltsin president clinton . and 're hoping together might send strong signal american business community support efforts invest russia , united states , ex- im opec department commerce , support . q my question , yeltsin position deliver making russia -- senior administration official : we think . i would note president yeltsin 's prime minister , mr. chernomyrdin , worked 30 years russian oil gas sector . he chair high-level commission vice president , vice president gore , try break barriers currently exist western investment oil gas sector . we believe commitment make committee important committee . and 're looking forward work . q what type mechanism already place administer private sector portion program ? and u.s. directly involved tail end distribution actual funds money simply turned russian government distribution ? senior administration official : are talking variety programs listed ? it depends program . in cases , though , either working american pbos american government agencies ensure money obviously well spent , money gets intended source . that 's obligation congress ensure money well spent account money . we done last couple months intensively continue programs . but quite different . for instance , area grant food medical assistance , grant food carried usda usda accounts delivery food . for grant medical assistance , 've working project hope private organization . for housing -- instance , resettlement russian officers , 'll working group american pbos . on democratization projects , 're working directly russian private individuals private foundations . we 're working journalists russia media project may noticed . so literally 30 40 different activities rubrics 're going carried slightly different ways . some directly russian government , russian citizens . q the jackson-vanik restrictions remain cocom restrictions remain , tell us president ? senior administration official : well , george noted yesterday , president yeltsin raised irritants relationship . the president noted . i think 's fair say go back government return washington look questions , 'll get back russian government . q you prepared questions got ? senior administration official : we prepared questions . we 've looked . but 're prepared make quick decision weekend . they require -- let explain , particularly jackson-vanik . they require consultation congress . they require consultation american jewish community . and 're sensitive concerns . and 'll want go back talk take action . q is package designed go congress anything point ? senior administration official : as i said beginning , advantage particular package funds allocated appropriated congress . so administration go back congress seek additional authority fund efforts . in effect , begin tomorrow , i know many agencies responsible projects begin tomorrow . and 's advantage particular initiative . q if , president says , long-term , long-haul thing , members congress moment heading moscow , n't talking going congress suggesting president russia prepared go congress various things ? senior administration official : i think 've clear . the president discussing weekend president yeltsin additional ideas american funding additional projects , ideas . we major congressional delegation left last night , headed representative gephardt 'll want consult delegation members congress anything . and 'll also want consult allies . so 's stands . q we 've told repeatedly number items represent different new ways spending money already appropriated . could tick items represents reprogramming least spending money ways previously set ? senior administration official : i think 've said projects either congress allocated money freedom support act ; funds left fy'92 . and administration took office new ideas funds might expended . we n't use freedom support act funds fy'92 funds . we went agency allocations -- ex-im , opic , usda -- tried look creative ways programs . and example food progress concessional loans . we hit brick wall another type funding usda . we could go forward legally , looked creative way ensure continued american market share ensure continued grain sales , think found . q where , example , getting money russian officer resettlement -- senior administration official : that 's freedom support act funds . q in words , money directly spent new ways , speak -- senior administration official : most grant projects see -- look general chart , second chart , 's broken grant credits . and look grants , technical cooperation projects total $ 281.9 million -- almost freedom support act funding . a little bit leftover funds fiscal year '92 . the nunn-lugar funds , course , know legislative history funds . q cooperation -- senior administration official : from fy '92 ? i n't exact figure . it considerable figure . q could tell us please , anything happened weekend break log jam ukraine russia start -- start i ii result 's happened -- senior administration official : both presidents , president yeltsin president clinton , discussing issue morning . in fact , n't yet gotten security arms control related issues . that morning 's session . i know president clinton strongly reinforcing top priority us . we 've talking russians ukrainians last couple weeks ways might help facilitate discussions . up point , important negotiation 's going essentially moscow kiev . and point essentially discussing ways could contribute discussion , help move things forward essentially . but terms coming weekend , i n't yet know . in couple hours 'll know . q ? just follow-up financing . is robbing peter pay boris -- since 's current year appropriations , taken anyplace 's earmarked put fund ? senior administration official : there smoke mirrors , i think 's important point note . we could given page assistance numbers included out-year funding . we 're going make long-term commitment many projects -- instance , enterprise funds , privatization effort , housing effort . and 've already talked russians long-term commitment . we could put really big numbers could bigger package , wanted make point : this package fy '93 . it 's funds . and 're going say 're going . and president feels strongly . in past legacy western governments , combination governments , put large budget figures number reasons 're able meet , 're determined , president determined , carry every single program package . and 'll . but longer-term commitment , 's part discussions economics weekend . we 're looking russian ideas effectively support reform . and 've told commitment programs beyond fiscal year . q taken way -- senior administration official : no , n't . okay , question , reprogrammed funds ; taken countries pay programs russia ? the answer , done . q in terms funding , available monies left -- simply find creative way find money somewhere else . does n't , fact , support -- theory ? senior administration official : not . i n't think . that 's particular example , example grain sales . the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program short-term loans russia pay back within 12 15 months . you know russia 's debt problem , russia unable meet commitments . so looked way two things : meet russia 's requirement grain . they 're net grain importer massive scale , also meet objective making sure american farmers chance sell products russia . and simply look another way finance . and legislative authority . this program successful areas . we tried former soviet union , thought . q is n't really bush-clinton aid package russia , since funds really first derived initiatives put forward president bush ? senior administration official : no , i n't think 's fair characterization . a lot funds appropriated u.s. congress 1991 , 1992 . this administration took office inherited obligations bush administration made . but long six seven week review program . we decided meet commitments made previous administration . but gone well beyond funding enterprise fund , idea , idea filled program . there number attached . in grouping together projects trying make coherent whole privatization effort , i would say , another clinton initiative . further , listened russian government listened russian military told us resettlement officers important political economic social reasons . and president clinton responded . and making long-term commitment beyond demonstration project 're going figure way much trying settle officers . i would also say president given impetus us agencies think much broadly democratization , experience comparative advantage lends russian experience . and calling creation democracy corps , another new initiative , 're hopeful take resources private sector well american government , achieve objective . so i would characterize way . and know , i career civil servant . i last administration . i 'm familiar last administration . and i would characterize clinton assistance package russia . q there 's lot criticism aid past gotten people . is anything outside ombudsman , guarantee money disappear 's administered russian government ? senior administration official : i think -- i know president senior officials government concerned american money spent wisely get source 's intended -- 's intended . and 're going take great care -- aid state department take great care making sure funds expended properly 're reaching source . i would package simply package support solely russian government . some projects , especially democratization exchanges , going worked directly russian private individuals , businesses . the private enterprise support another example . senior administration official : if i could add word point regard ssd-related programs , one area 've looking , closely consideration actually using russian firms subcontracting kinds programs . they would working closely , course , american firms , would prime contractors . but fine example , i think , -- imaginative flexible approach toward getting funding grassroots level , ground russia ; time ensuring spent efficiently purposes intended . q when would democracy corps start ? exactly see happening ? how would get ground ? senior administration official : well , president today calling creation democracy corps . i think 's fair say 're going work framework next couple weeks . ambassador simons takes duties may 1st . but effect 've already started , last couple weeks administration begun reach people private sector come us asking us help facilitate activities russia . and 've said helpful . we 've also tried kind coordinate much effective way activities government . we 10 15 agencies active russia one way another . we think makes sense draw together focus efforts . q excuse . how much $ 1.6 billion actually spent united states american made goods ? senior administration official : i n't figures , perhaps could try work something next couple days . q this figure larger figure press -- program grow yesterday result discussions , far mark ? senior administration official : no , i think -- unfortunately press little bit mark , i 'm sorry say . no , package -- president clinton put us work seven weeks ago package . and briefed intensively . he contributed lot intellectual leadership package . he contributed lot ideas package . and i think 's fair say rough package worked two weeks ago . we refining ever since . we spent couple days last week going russian government , embassy washington government moscow embassy . and 's evolving . but particular package together two weeks . q where yeltsin 's input ? there much talk president wanted get yeltsin 's views specifically needed forth . is years ? senior administration official : no , 's . president yeltsin several occasions told us , instance , support creation private businesses important ; resettlement russian military officers important ; first foremost effort privatize state industries important . and try make centerpiece technical assistance part package . we listened . on privatization effort , working russian government months trying work details . so russian government programs involved every step way . but let get part question . the president also using weekend talk broader set initiatives might undertake . and 're looking ideas . the president brought ideas table -- instance , energy environment housing . but 're looking russian ideas . we need consult congress ; need consult allied governments also active . q there 's essentially nothing happened last day half measurably altered package came ? senior administration official : this particular package , i said , worked ready two weeks ago . we since consulted russian government final stages development , weekend 've primarily talked future , united states western countries support reform russia , base objective . q i noticed -- money appropriated train bankers businessmen officers . can tell job training workers displaced privatization ? senior administration official : you 're right ; program train russian -- young russians banking financial services united states . part housing initiative , 's build housing units , 's retrain russian officers retiring professions . q money job training workers whose jobs disappearing privatization -- senior administration official : we yet allocated money . q why ? q $ 6 million going build 450 housing units . is n't lot money per unit given western dollar buy former soviet union ? senior administration official : if want housing right way , 's building framework house , 've got think utilities . you 've got think purchase land . you 've got think sewage gas electricity forth . and 's also retraining . it 's enough put retired -- officer coming -- riga tallin vilnius house western russia . we think obligation try retrain officers well . this responding request russian government . q $ 6 million go retrain -- senior administration official : that 's right . q are talking apartment buildings single -- senior administration official : we 're talking single , individual dwellings . q you 're saying 450 families served ? senior administration official : what i want -- i thought i pointed earlier , demonstration project . what n't want -- given experience germans turks italians building housing western russian , want leap huge amount money . what want work next couple months try figure american organizations private sector best way get job done . i noted long-term commitment . and i would expect would put lot money future . but want wisely ; want spend money wisely . q what program convinces protect russia 's reforms russia position may back money 're supposed pay back , especially considering debt problem ? senior administration official : well , look , i think 's important note united states capability fuel continuation russian reform . it 's got collective western effort , 're looking allies well . but beyond , 's really russians going decide fate reform . we simply play role , feel obligation , consistent national interests . q did president say value u.s. contribution would create security prosperity united states ? so program ? senior administration official : i think go back fundamental objective policy toward russia , want everything support continuation reform . we convinced reformers stay power , 'll able continue drawdown nuclear forces , foreign policy cooperation economic interaction , three benefits united states reform russia . so 's simple question . you ca n't say program answer . it 's long-term question make long-term commitment . q and question russia 's ability repay , convinces 'll able pay seven 15 years ? senior administration official : well , russian government made commitment repay , 're hoping reform continues , continue improve oil gas sector earn additional hard currency revenues , russia position six seven years pay back loans . q substantial government-to-government loan 've ever gotten russians ? senior administration official : i n't want answer authoritatively . i n't go back 20 30 years . but last four five years , yes , previous way financed grain exports really ensure private bank loans . this different type effort . q government loans sector recall ? i know n't done -- senior administration official : i think 's fair say new unique effort .\", \"you probably mean `` rohypnol '' , member

a : in us , currently virgina district columbia prohibit usage radar detectors . new york prohibits use large trucks . in canada , illegal manitoba , ontario , quebec , newfoundland pei ( prince edward island ) . they apparently illegal , , europe . legislation would make illegal pending many jurisdictions ; chances legislation passing varies great deal . q : where radar detector detectors used ? do really work ? a : usage spreading rapidly ; initially used canada , appearing new york virginia . it unsafe assume use connecticut d.c . they work detecting certain frequency radiated many currently available super het radar detectors ; brands detector radiate strongly others , thus likely spotted . new radar detectors becoming available may detected current generation detector detectors . note detector may spotted one devices turned . q : what vascar ? is kind radar ? a : vascar nothing fancy stopwatch time-speed-distance computer . it depends operator pressing buttons target vehicle passes landmarks . no radar signals emitted vascar system . q : what ka band radar ? where used ? should radar detector able handle ? a : ka band recently made available fcc use us so-called photo-radar installations . in installations , low-powered beam aimed across road 45 degree angle direction traffic , picture taken vehicles radar unit determines violation speed limit . tickets mailed owner vehicle . because low power 45 degree angle , many people believe radar detector give reasonable warning ka band radar unit , although manufacturers radar detectors added capability anyway . the number locales photo-radar use limited , question legality units . best advice : learn photo radar units look like , keep track used ( else , n't speed . ) q : do radar jammers work ? are legal ? a : quick answer : no , not usa . detailed answer : cheap radar jammers work well . jammers work expensive usually property military . jammers major violation regulations federal communications commission usa . driving technique vehicle dynamics questions : q : what understeer oversteer ? a : understeer oversteer terms describing behaviour car cornering near ` limit ' ( limit adhesion , . ) most drivers normally drive hard enough terms descriptive situations encounter . simply put , tell whether car wants go straight corner ( steer ` less ' , ` understeer ' ) wants turn corner ( ` oversteer ' . ) understeer commonly designed production cars untrained drivers , inadvertantly traveling fast , wo n't get trouble . understeer may also induced using much throttle corner . oversteer designed performance oriented cars ; may induced lifting throttle ( trailing throttle oversteer , tto ) . in extreme cases , lifting throttle may induce much oversteer car reacts fishtailing spinning . some technical details : corner speed , tires car develop called ` slip angles ' ; slip angle angular difference direction car traveling direction steering wheel directing car travel . in understeer , front wheels greater slip angle rear wheels . in oversteer , rear wheels greater slip angle front wheels . q : what rev-matched downshift ? a : when downshifting , engine must rotating faster lower gear higher gear . however , downshift , normally declutch lift foot throttle , revs drop rather increase . in rev-matched downshift , blip throttle re-engaging clutch engine already new speed . this results much smoother faster downshift . q : what heel-and-toe mean ? a : heel-and-toe technique used rev-matched downshift braking . this normally challenging , need right foot brake throttle . it called heel-and-toe use one end foot brake , throttle match revs downshift . in many modern cars misnomer ; often must use ball foot brake right side throttle . note race car drivers skip clutch , use left foot brake right foot throttle , accomplishing thing . q : what double-clutch downshifting ? a : while right foot , left foot one three things : nothing , declutch , declutch twice . the reason declutching twice match speeds two shafts transmission speed engine . this usually coupled rev-matching , engine neutral clutch engaged , throttle blipped shafts transmission speed . the procedure follows : ( 0 ) declutch ( 1 ) move gearshift lever neutral ( 2 ) engage clutch ( 3 ) match revs ( 4 ) declutch ( 5 ) move gearshift lever next lower gear ( 6 ) engage clutch this sounds like lot work , practice becomes natural . the problem double-clutching solves normally function synchronizers within gearbox . in transmissions without synchros worn synchros , double-clutching makes much easier shift . basically , double-clutch well , using synchros . this generally unnecessary street cars synchros good condition . q : what numbers acceleration 0-60 , 1/4 mile , skidpad , slalom times auto magazines really mean ? may compared ? a : in short , 1 ) much magazines want believe , 2 ) almost never . in detail : acceleration numbers ( 0-60mph 1/4 mile times us ) may vaguely compared long come source . testing procedures vary much magazine magazine comparing road & track number car & driver number quite pointless . keep mind , , variation applies driver driver street ; driver major ( often * * major ) part equation . skidpads vary , even n't , skidpad figures really tests stickiness stock tires ; change radically tire compounds change . do not make assumptions comparative handling , say , two sports sedans based skidpad numbers . this suggest skidpads without value , however . skidpads excellent educational tool driving schools . they simply limited value comparison anything except tires . slalom times slightly useful ; test small parts automobile 's transient response . however , also heavily influenced stock rubber car , test many corners car 's envelope . they do not tell need know making buying decision . for example , n't tell rear end car road suddenly goes off-camber . when car adjustable suspension , tests usually done ` sport ' setting , may quite unsuitable daily driving . the list caveats could go page page . q : my buddy claims wide tires n't make difference , according freshman physics textbook , ca n't ever accelerate corner 1.0g . does know 's talking ? a : 1 ) short : n't got clue . 2 ) detail : equations friction used freshman physics textbooks presume surfaces smooth , dry non-deformable , none properly apply tire traction except case stone cold tire dry pavement far proper operating temperature . pavement _never_ smooth ; always irregular greater lesser extent . tires , really dry solid ( rubber substance natural form liquid , coerced semblance solidity chemical magic ) , deform match surface pavement vehicle traveling . in tire operating temperature , grip actually generated shear stresses inside deformed rubber , anything even remotely resembling friction freshman physics sense term . the colder tire relative operating temperature , closer behaviour traditional concept friction ; much hotter proper operating temperature , likely possibility part tire actually `` reverting '' liquid , mostly like happen deep tread , causing characteristic blisters chunking . ( this latter , though , almost completely unlikely happen normal street driving , unless 're competition driver lot high speed track driving , n't worry . ) because tire traction completely domain simple friction , obey freshman physics equation ; thus dragsters accelerate 1.0g race cars corner brake 1.0g . because simple friction apply , actually possible different sized contact patches generate differing amounts grip . an actual analysis tire behavior would require techniques finite element analysis , due complexity mechanism . misc . questions : q : what < name acronym > stand ? a : here list names commonly asked ; careful soliciting meanings names misinformation abounds net . in particular , never ask rec.humor want useful result . saab : svenska aeroplan a . b. , the swedish airplane corporation alfa : societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili , the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat : fabbrica italiana di automobili torino , the italian automobile manufacturers turin bmw : bayerische motoren werke , bavarian motor works mg : morris garage q : does vw porsche ? a : no . porsche publicly held company , controlled porsche piech families . porsche extensive business dealings vw/audi , causes confusion . since currently porsche financial difficulty , possibility mercedes vw may interested purchasing company near future , speculation time .\", 'i want start list syclone typhoon owners . if interested participating , please contact via e-mail .', \"sorry , * neither * 'dictates ' cost . it 's negotiation . whether 's front honda dealership dickering war , removed larger economic scale ( ie , saturn ca n't sell 's price , price drops , company stops building ) , remains negotiated value controlled market forces . to think consumer controls price ludicrous . if consumer controled price , cars would * free * ... and one would build cars . regards , charles\", 'i get . one organization wants abolish age consent laws , whereas contrast wants abolish age consent laws . this makes respectable belong one organization , .', \"what `` dc '' stand ? could n't antichiropractic posting chiropractor , could ? my curiosity piqued . prostate ca especially troublesome entity chiropractors . it typically causes bone pain due spinal metastases gets manipulated frequently . manipulating cancer riddled bone highly dangerous , since fracture . i 've seen least three cases happened resulting neurologic damage , including paraplegia . this one instance knowing read x-rays really help chiropractor stay trouble . do chiropractors know bony mets prostate look like ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- gordon banks n3jxp | `` skepticism chastity intellect , geb @ cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | shameful surrender soon .

a : typically , see something like 195/60hr14 . 195 overall width tire millimeters , tread usually narrower . the 60 ` aspect ratio ' ; indicates height sidewall tire relative overall width . our example tire sidewall height 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm . the 14 wheel diameter inches ; also special tires called ` trx ' tires three digit metric wheel diameter designations , like 390 , millimeters . the r means radial , h speed rating indicating highest speed tire , properly inflated carrying appropriate load , may safely operate . common speed ratings s ( 112mph ) , t ( 118mph ) , h ( 130mph ) , v ( 150mph . ) recent changes method specifying tire sizes move speed rating different part designation ; may therefore find designations like 195/60r14 85h ; 85 indicates per-tire load associated speed rating -- exceeding load continuous operation rated speed dangerous practice . what follows table showing number ` load indices ' corresponding maximum per-tire loads : load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 max load ( kg ) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 note usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs table . in cases , letters p lt may found front tire size ; lt designation indicates light truck , p designation indicates passenger car . if letter given , application tire passenger car usage . as far i know , letters appear us market . the lt designation prinicipally interest owners light trucks utility vehicles . for owner passenger vehicle , meaningful difference tire p designation one designation . if aspect ratio omitted , probably 80 , may 78 . tires ms ( mud/snow ) designation may speed rating reduced 20 km/h ( 12mph . ) there additional set ratings tires temperature , traction , treadwear . temperature traction graded a , b , c ( a best c worst ) ; treadwear numeric rating . these values limited value , assigned somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturers thus useful comparing different brands tires . q : my car tires funny size designation : 185/65hr390 ; put normal tires car ? a : your tires called trx tires ; devised michelin . because somewhat different bead design , incompatible normal tires ; michelin used different diameter wheel could mounted wrong type wheel ( conventional tires could mounted trx type wheels . ) you need aquire different wheels put normal tire car ; barely possible fit normal tires trx wheels , horribly dangerous ( tires may simply peel rims corner , possibly blow high speed . ) trx type tires becoming hard find ; addition michelin , avon makes suitable tires . goodyear apparently discontinued line trx tires . q : can i rotate radials side side , rotate one side car ? a : car tire manufacturers differing views subject ; many say swapping radials left right hand sides car ok ( group includes michelin goodyear ) ; others ( example , pirelli nokia ) void warranties swapping done . the best advice read tire manual carefully rotating tires , stick manufacturer 's recommendations . q : how many snow tires i buy , i buy 2 , end car i put ? a : in short , 4 , ends . to explain , many drivers areas n't get excessive snow n't drive agressively ( ) snow conditions get away two snows drive wheels , circumstances dangerous practice . with rear wheel drive car , choose able start car going ( function rear axle ) stopping turning car ( function front axle . ) in front wheel drive car , start , stop , turn front end . the primary risk putting snow tires front put brakes going downhill , run serious risk going downhill backwards . radar detectors speed limits : q : why n't comments radar detectors speed limits q & a posting ? a : because questions detectors speed limits crossposted misc.consumers rec.autos . * always start long , tedious , pointless flame wars . if want talk either topics , please subscribe rec.autos alt.flame keep . safety equipment : q : do airbags really work ? a : preliminary statistics suggest following : airbags work much better belts ; good 3 point belts alone work much better airbags alone , airbags + 3 point belts work slightly better 3 point belts alone . the con airbags designs tend burn driver 's hands venting byproducts explosion occurs inside bag , designs ( ) may knock driver 's hands wheel , making retention control vehicle bag deflates difficult . brake questions : q : do i always need get rotors disk brakes turned ? midas always wants . a : no . there specific conditions mandate turning replacing rotors ; shops try make little extra money replacing rotors often strictly necessary . rotors warped warped , lightly grooved , need replace turn . note also rotors ( rotors many hondas good example ) narrow begin practical turn ; must replaced become thin , warped , badly grooved . q : they tell i downshift braking slow car . is really good idea ? a : it used good idea , back days mediocre , fade prone drum brakes . in modern disc brake equipped cars , use downshifting slow car really necessary , except cases long , steep downhill runs . otherwise , modern disc brakes adequate stop passenger car circumstances , much cheaper repair clutch linings . on hand , many standard driver 's license tests usa still specify driver tested downshift braking ; i suggest taking us driver 's test , either 1 ) learn smoothly ( takes time practice ) 2 ) borrow car automatic take test . q : how often i replace brake fluid ? a : probably often . traditional brake fluids tend absorb water ; water corrode internal parts brake system also lower boiling point fluid . dot-3 type older fluids ; dot-4 dot-5 newer specifications . the principal differences wet dry boiling points ; dry boiling point important fresh brake fluid , wet boiling point important older brake fluid . dot-3 fluids lowest wet dry boiling point _requirements_ ; dot-4 fluids better boiling point requirements ; dot-5 fluids best boiling point requirements ( dot-5 fluids clearly superior ; see next q & a details . ) while requirements imply dot-4 fluids better dot-3 fluids , may specific cases dot-3 fluid preferable , mostly competition applications . otherwise , dot-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel . replacement year recommended dot-4 fluids , although agressive drivers may profit changing fluid frequently , least bleeding modest amount fluid brake calipers fairly regularly . q : what dot-5 brake fluids ? a : this breaks two parts . the dot-5 specification looks excellent performance , first dot-5 fluids silicone based . silicone fluids tricky proposition . unlike dot-3 dot-4 fluids , absorb water . while may sound like feature , problem water present pools systems , interfering braking performance corroding metals spot pooling occuring . the water tend migrate downwards braking system brake calipers , corrosion occurs . because phenomenon , essential converting silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly beforehand ; even recommend replacing rubber parts brake system converting silicone fluids . two issues come silicone fluids : 1 ) difficult pour cleanly ( , without air bubbles ) , interferes getting good brake pedal feel , 2 ) generally much higher boiling points dot-4 fluids , high temperature failure modes indistinguishable effect boiling dot-4 fluids . silicone fluids may make sense street car applications , certainly recommended high performance driving applications , economics questionable street use . i recently become aware new fluids meet dot-5 standard contain silicones ; fluids appear reasonably compatible older dot-3 dot-4 fluids , i little information time . q : abs available cars i 'm looking , costs . is worth ? a : this cut dried answer ; therefore , answer quite long order cover pros cons . the short answer abs costs , initially , maintain , generally work better ` average driver ' ( say , driver extensive experience high performance driving techniques ) , may require ` unlearning ' obsolete braking techniques like pump braking unlearned case . now long answer . abs works monitering wheels car , looking signs locked brakes . it may may able able distinguish different wheels ( several systems market . ) it detect impending lockup ( would really want ideal world ) , existence lockup . the sensors used vary ; less well designed sensors sensitive tire size , brake pad material , may cease function properly owner deviates original equipment oe-equivalent components . when sensors detect lockup , abs system responds unlocking brakes ( either individually , , depending system . ) if driver keeps foot firmly planted , abs end cycling locked unlocked states ( sensor existed could detect _impending lockup_ , could sit right point , maximum braking effect achieved . ) this pulsing often felt brake pedal , system cycles . the percentage time brakes truly engaged called ` duty cycle ' ; typically abs system 40 % on dry pavement , trained driver beat duty cycle quite reliably using technique called threshold braking ; wet pavement , braking chancy abs outperform threshold braking nearly every time . unfortunately , mud snow , often maximum braking effect acheived brakes locked ; audi , manufacturers producing abs-equipped cars , seen fit provide disable switch abs system eventuality . a particularly important feature abs preserves steering control . this case simply , braking near limit turn wheel , abs release brakes sees steering-triggered lockup , back percentage time brakes applied . braking distances lengthen accordingly . an important caution : abs exceed maximum theoretical braking force given situation ; start sliding glare ice , n't expect abs system help much . the coefficient friction changed presence abs system car . as far maintenence goes , addition potential restrictions i 've listed , worry following : 1 ) parts costs much higher ; oe master cylinder obscure european sedan lists $ 185 , oe master cylinder abs-equipped version car lists $ 1000 . most manufacturers explicitly forbid use dot-5 ( silicone ) brake fluids abs-equipped vehicles . because potential cost replacement corroded brake system components , regular ( i suggest annual ) replacement brake fluid becomes important . q : what threshold braking business ? a : [ normally , i 'd put consumers q & a , recent publicity number accidents involving police drivers abs-equipped chevy caprices suggests section needed -- rpw ] threshold braking technique practiced serious high performance drivers ; made habit , replaces ` stab pedal lock 'em ' panic habit entirely , much prefered . basically , premise tires generate maximum braking force started slide , wheels lock entirely . drivers threshold brake learn feel ` threshold ' feels like , learn search hit application brake pedal . in many cars , feel near threshold pedal starts firm depress . in case , ca n't hear tires whine bit , 're near threshold . in car abs , often twinge pedal system starts cycling ; driver backs pedal tad twinge felt , close threshold 'll probably achieve better stopping distances punched let abs take . recently , rash publicity number accidents , one death , involving police cars equipped abs systems . the police departments question quickly blamed new abs systems , according autoweek magazine , seems clear problem lack training ; none involved officers recent performance driving training . there reason believe drivers reacted pulsing brake pedal ` pump braking ' , old discredited technique stabbing releasing brake pedal , goal try get brakes back failing hydraulic system . if think minute , 'll realize pump braking must cut effective operation working brake system least 1/2 , cut 40 % duty cycle abs system much , giving brakes wrong reason . threshold braking advantage effective useful technique regardless whether car abs ; fear failed hydraulic system , one two stabs pedal sufficient . gas questions : q : does high octane gasoline help ? a : maybe , maybe . some cars knock sensors , adjust engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline used . on cars , however , use cheapest gas makes car run well . check owner 's manual details car needs . q : my car made leaded gasoline . will unleaded gas hurt ? a : it possible unleaded gas may * slightly * increase valve wear , although amoco oil company argues otherwise . the actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable , however , modern leaded gasolines actually contain little lead . you , however , check owner 's manual ; many cars early 1970s actually require leaded gasoline . q : do fuel treatments help ?

, risking even heavier losses top already sustained . in short , friends , her majesty 's navy sailed trap . the events unfolding south atlantic carry strange , ironic echoes past . for weeks 've hearing countless commentators referring british task force '' armada '' ( quote ) . the british people ought uneasy description . the original spanish armada 400 years ago renowned seemingly invincible fighting force , came grief naval disaster complete changed course history -- none english navy destroyed spanish armada . the original spanish armada put sea 1588 reign england 's queen elizabeth i . the armada invasion fleet carrying thousands crack fighting men invade england . they met daring sea dogs sir francis drake . drake small , fast ships turned tables spanish armada changing rules battle . the english fleet equipped new longer-range guns , stayed upwind reach . from english pounded , smashed , shattered big ships mighty armada . when , barely half spanish fleet left limp back port . drake 's defeat spanish armada shock world . it opened door england queen elizabeth i start expansion truly global empire . today , 400 years later , history seems come full circle . queen elizabeth ii witnessing dismantling world empire whose heyday began queen elizabeth i , cultures england spain confrontation . once so-called armada preparing invasion , time armada british , spanish . four hundred years ago sir francis drake hero day ;

'' vast deposits oil known exist continental shelf argentina falklands , known nearly 10 years . in way explain timing sudden military offensive argentina month , oil explains even less argentine seizure south georgia island . south georgia island 800 miles east falklands known oil deposits anywhere near ; compared south georgia , falklands island paradise . south georgia island covered rugged mountains , treacherous valleys , glaciers , semi-permanent snow . most uninhabitable . on top , argentina absolutely legal historical claim south georgia island . in respect stands sharp contrast falklands . in early 1830s falklands occupied argentine colonists . in 1833 british expelled took island . for historical reasons , argentina argues falklands really belong argentina , britain . but argument possible south georgia island . it always controlled britain , never argentina spain . the argentine seizure south georgia island looks even unreasonable military point view . argentina 's leaders military men think military terms . they well aware ahead time far-off south georgia island could possibly held long . by seizing setting absorb military defeat , island retaken britain . so question : why argentina 's military junta bother seemingly worthless south georgia island ? my friends , answers questions military , political economic . south georgia island possesses enormous military secret . it 's giant underground installation buried mountains northwest end island . the real reason so-called falkland crisis secret installation , together two similar installations i describe shortly . the secret military complexes existence many years ; new . what new accelerated nuclear war timetable american bolshevik war planners washington . for past two months i 've reporting details new war plan quickly i obtain verify . the plan calls nuclear war one erupt september year 1982 ! ! it fast-approaching nuclear war threat caused so-called falklands crisis erupt . what going coordinated effort spoil part bolshevik grand strategy coming nuclear war . the mutual enemies american bolsheviks -- namely , rockefeller cartel -- russia 's new rulers kremlin behind present crisis . they trying ruin phase # 3 `` project z '' war plan i revealed last month . that phase world domination american bolsheviks russia united states destroyed nuclear war one . as i mentioned last month , key plan existence secret weapons stockpiles various places around world . the american bolshevik military planners america working bolshevik agents key military positions countries set war . having done , intend ride nuclear holocaust caused , safe cozy government war bunkers ! when warring nations finally lie smoldering exhausted , bolsheviks leave shattered remains host countries . they rendezvous secret weapons installations bring weapons open . they confront world remaining fresh , up-to-date , powerful military force earth ; using military power , become undisputed rulers world -- , plan , plan pave way world domination soon setting nuclear war one matter months . the rockefeller cartel russia 's new anti-bolshevik rulers working together race time try head bolshevik war plan . last month i mentioned bolsheviks benefitting war preparations started rockefellers long ago . it three years since rockefellers dislodged prime movers united states government bolsheviks . since time united states government house divided , torn internal power struggles rival bolshevik rockefeller factions . but , united states dominated decades economically politically four rockefeller brothers . in 1961 brothers launched new long-range plan world domination . it two-prong strategy , half visible half secret , i first described long ago audio letter no . 28 . it plan united states arm teeth secret appearing disarm gradually . without repeating details , basic idea grandiose yet simple . by deliberately appearing weak , rockefeller-controlled united states would maneuver nuclear war russia . then secret weapons , including superweapons , would unleashed smash russia take world . when set grand plan motion 1961 , rockefeller brothers looking ahead nuclear war late 1970s . their military analysts concluded early war planned would different effects northern southern hemispheres . both superpowers , united states soviet union , located well northern hemisphere ; full-fledged nuclear powers -- great britain , france , red china , india . by contrast , strategic targets nuclear war southern hemisphere relatively far . in words , expected coming nuclear war would essentially northern hemisphere war . in all-out nuclear holocaust known serious radioactive fallout gradually spread affect even areas initially hit war . but limits far war clouds spread . it discovered long ago little mixing air northern southern hemispheres . in northern half planet , cold air north pole works way southward towards equator , works way back north warm air . a mirror image process takes southern half planet . northern southern hemisphere air meet equatorial zone , little air changes places . the military conclusion , friends , : coming nuclear war could ruin large areas northern hemisphere generations come ; calculations right , southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected war . this music ears four rockefeller brothers . a quick look globe world shows . the rockefeller cartel dominated latin america ever since world war ii . as i discussed first monthly audio letter , nelson rockefeller solidified cartel grip latin america war . he accomplished so-called `` coordinator hemispheric defense '' then-president franklin d. roosevelt . so takes care south american continent natural resources . then african continent . there , , rockefeller control already effect wide areas black africa , especially south equator . all thanks efforts john d. rockefeller iii , i detailed audio letter no . 36 . looking around globe , important remaining land masses standpoint world domination australia new zealand . thanks world war ii , wide open rockefellers . the rockefeller brothers decided establish secret military installations southern hemisphere use coming war . by means expected become masters surviving southern half planet earth northern hemisphere war . then , northern hemisphere gradually recovered nuclear holocaust , rockefeller empire would able pick pieces . in way third generation rockefeller brothers expected family dynasty inherit earth . in order control southern hemisphere militarily war , means would available project military power onto land mass . for example , revolts rockefeller domination would require troops -- blast beam weapons moon . the critical factor postwar military domination world found navy . a minimum two secret naval fleets would required -- one based south atlantic , south pacific . since reserve naval fleets kept secret northern hemisphere nuclear war , could built existing shipyards . new construction facilities built hidden . to hide entire shipyard small task ; take lot space . on top , essential ships remain hidden built . the best way achieve combine shipyard naval base one over-all secret installation . finally , secret naval installation invulnerable nuclear attack ; otherwise existence ever discovered prematurely , secret navy might wiped . the combined requirements secrecy , space , protection attack formidable ; one day 1959 , plans still early stages development , answer presented . during so-called banking trip sweden , david rockefeller given tour unique hidden naval port . the port hollowed solid granite cliffs come right water . the entrance port gigantic hole side cliff sealed enormous steel doors . inside big doorway water huge cavity hollowed accommodate ships . the rockefeller brothers military adviser decided bigger , secret , better protected version swedish hidden port wanted . a survey candidate sites initiated . the site survey covered coastal areas throughout southern hemisphere . many areas rejected quickly topography wrong . other areas rejected close equator . still others ruled many people living nearby , making desired level secrecy impossible . finally , essential sites chosen secret naval installations totally secure politically . at last sites secret naval installations selected . in south pacific , extreme southern new zealand selected . this i alluding audio letter no . 71 three months ago i called attention new zealand 's extreme importance coming war . in order obtain necessary space , secret new zealand naval installation divided two sites located close together . one extreme southwest tip south island mountain range known southern alps comes virtually water 's edge . the part installation built northwest tip stewart island , tip south island . the stewart island facility hollowed within rise known mt . anglem . the new zealand location met requirements . ever since world war ii government new zealand tied even closer united states great britain . the location far equator , installations buried deep mountains , protected nuclear attack . they also deep reached particle-beam attacks , new zealand site well situated command entire south pacific . in south atlantic even perfect site found . that site , friends , south georgia island . it located perfectly naval domination entire south atlantic . the tall , rugged mountains provided perfect location secret installation northwest tip 100-mile long island . it controlled great britain whose government , like new zealand , willing cooperate ; south georgia island virtually uninhabited except whaling station northeast coast . the whaling station 50 miles away secret new installation built , britain took chances . in 1965 whaling station closed . since time inhabitants south georgia island except dozen alleged antarctic scientists . construction secret naval facilities -- two new zealand , one south georgia island -- began early 1960 's . the techniques adapted used previously build large underground facilities , norad installation inside cheyenne mountain , colorado ; however techniques adapted radically new ways achieve construction access directly sea instead overland . in way , sheltering mountain left undisturbed appearance construction . the cuts mountain side necessary let ships kept small possible well camouflaged . like swedish hidden naval port arrangement , entrances secret installations sealed . when sealed , entrance virtually impossible detect unless know exactly ; unlike large construction projects , tailings piles leftover rock lying around attract attention . the man-made caverns house secret naval installations enormous , rock debris disposed sea . once secret naval facilities built , outfitted ship construction docksite storage . the fake disarmament united states 1960s contributed greatly task . from 1961 1968 one man played pivotal role elaborate rockefeller scheme . he then-secretary defense robert mcnamara . all 60 's mcnamara presided public paring back america 's visible military power . this included closing dismantling entire shipyards . what told shipyard equipment went afterwards . where went , friends , new secret installations outfitted new zealand south georgia island ! the secret naval installations used duplication facilities reproduce certain ships submarines designed built united states . as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently , cheaper build two ships time . that especially true second ship exact duplicate first . this become even true recent years use computerized manufacturing techniques . the secret naval fleets built secret installations made duplicates -- exact duplicates certain ships submarines . they nuclear powered -- nuclear `` subs '' ; nuclear cruisers ; nuclear destroyers ; yes , nuclear aircraft carriers , three . a secret twin built u.s.s . nimitz , u.s.s . eisenhower , newly-launched u.s.s . carl vincent . all financed gigantic cost overruns , called , constantly hear defense department ; three carriers provided full complement aircraft whose manufacture financed way ! the ships secret american bolshevik naval fleets duplicates nuclear-powered vessels . even , secret naval ships possess one key difference . last month i revealed so-called `` stealth program '' succeeded developing kind electromagnetic invisibility shield . this technique makes object invisible distance distorting light waves vicinity . a whole new fleet phantom war-planes going crash production use principle ; , friends , secret american bolshevik navy ships already outfitted similar stealth-field equipment ! the stealth principle actually easier apply ships airplanes room powerful equipment generates field . after nuclear war one , secret stealth navy american bolsheviks would light years ahead navy left earth . it would perfect intended role world domination . the rockefellers set motion long ago , friends , three years ago lost control united states military . now 's american bolsheviks control , bent war . these secret naval installations precipitated called `` falklands crisis . '' topic # 2 -- in audio letter ( r ) no . 73 last month i described '' project z '' , new bolshevik three-phase strategy nuclear war one . an elite group american bolshevik military planners flushing plan right secret war-room washington . it 's plan united states strike first nuclear blow , followed all-out thermonuclear war russia . having set holocaust , bolsheviks certain countries plan rise safe comfortable war bunkers . finally nuclear war one fizzles stalemate , plan leave behind ashes united states allies . activating phase # 3 grand strategy , plan unveil secret weapons , especially secret naval fleets . with plan conquer rule left world . the united states know dead gone ; eyes bolsheviks , outcome constitute victory . up nuclear war timetable i first revealed two months ago still track . they still shooting nuclear war begin september year 1982 ! time fast running . the bolsheviks sprinting fast toward war ; , friends , bolsheviks runners race . they two deadly enemies , equally determined trip bolsheviks . one enemy bolsheviks rockefeller cartel ; enemy new anti-bolshevik ruling clique russia ; two mutual enemies bolsheviks pooling efforts certain ways . in audio letter no . 71 three months ago i reported limited , new anti-bolshevik coalition works rockefeller cartel russians . the january 26 meeting haig gromyko geneva , switzerland , turning point formation coalition . it reality , responsible so-called `` falkland crisis '' dominating headlines . it emphasized new relationship rockefeller cartel russia falls far short true alliance . they major disputes settled , time called truce deal mutual deadly enemy -- bolsheviks america . the first priority russians rockefellers slow bolshevik preparations imminent nuclear war . if , time side rockefeller cartel certain political movements i discussed last summer audio letter no . 67 . a slow-down nuclear war timetable also give breathing space additional anti-bolshevik actions implemented . the joint rockefeller-russian planners decided mid-february military action bolsheviks essential quickly . no type action hope taking effect fast enough prevent nuclear war end summer . the exact details `` project z '' war plan known either rockefellers russians , general outlines known i described last month . it decided military action devised would undermine phase # 3 bolshevik war plan -- , bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations fleets southern hemisphere attacked crippled . by working together , rockefeller cartel russians able devise attack plan neither could carried alone . the rockefeller group , built originally controlled bases , provided detailed intelligence best way attack . the russians enormous military machine provided muscle actually carry attack . it essential devise scheme would enable secret fleets south atlantic south pacific attacked . survival intact either fleet would leave bolshevik war plan still workable . military analysts concluded quickly direct assault new zealand facilities question . there combination commandos , frogmen , military force could possibly keep attack secret outside world . any attack new zealand bases would set war rockefellers russians want prevent . but situation south atlantic different matter . in way , greatest asset south georgia island also achilles ' heel . the extreme isolation protected secrecy south georgia base also made covert military assault feasible . the key lay argentina long-standing claims falkland islands . as i mentioned topic # 1 , rockefeller cartel dominated latin america decades . cartel operatives sent argentina work deal government military junta . the historic dispute falkland islands used provide ruse , military cover , enable south georgia base attacked . the argentine generals told everything situation means , told enough make clear . as inducement cooperate , argentine leaders promised handsome rewards . they guaranteed shooting , falkland islands would remain argentine hands . this guarantee included promise covert military assistance needed royal navy . and bolster troubled argentine economy , promised rockefeller cartel help develop immense offshore oil reserves . with combined promises military glory financial rewards , argentine military junta agreed plan . on march 19 argentina carried act # 1 joint attack plan . a group argentine scrap-metal merchants , things , landed abandoned old whaling station south georgia island . supposedly dismantle old buildings cart sell . while also raised argentine flag work-site . the british , always nervous south georgia island , promptly reacted expected . the british antarctic survey ship `` endurance '' put 22 marines ashore . they drove scrap merchants tore argentine flag . the incident provided desired excuse argentine junta bring simmering 150-year-old falklands dispute boil . from time time past , argentina claimed south georgia part falklands administered way britain . that argument flimsy came handy . it nothing new hear argentine leaders , hint really afoot . during late march , argentine military forces started assembling assault falklands . `` nothing new '' , thought british high command . argentina carried threatening maneuvers past many times . it believed ; april 2 argentine forces unexpected . after many past false alarms , time actually invaded seized islands . all argentine public statements emphasized long-standing historical claims falklands ; good measure , next day small argentine force also seized far-off south georgia island . the force small gave appearance initially side show argentina 's point view ; however , small contingent 22 royal marines overpowered bundled island along group 13 alleged scientists . that moment payoff joint rockefeller-russian attack plan . thanks elaborate distraction staged argentine forces , special commando team got onto island undetected . based detailed rockefeller information base , team moved location mountain directly cavernous secret base . special high-speed drilling equipment set rockefeller members team russian members concentrated military defense . by late evening , april 3 , military high command london finally learned really taking place . the secret south georgia base attack virtually means possible . the joint rockefeller-russian team drilling shaft mountain toward hollowed cavern inside . it matter time drill would break ceiling giant hidden naval base . once hole made , next step obvious . the rockefeller-russian team would put weapon kind hole . the best guess would nerve gas . the shock waves went highest levels british government evening april 3 hardly described , friends . the thatcher government , like so-called reagan administration america , bolshevik controlled . that 's margaret thatcher always says , `` me , '' time reagan administration says anything russia . both governments party secret nuclear war plan complete betrayal people respective countries , evening april 3 suddenly discovered precious war plan deep , deep trouble . immediately thatcher government started assembling naval armada sail south atlantic . haste order day . the drilling south georgia island proceeding around clock . the best estimates drilling would break roof naval base three weeks , april 24 . if help reach south georgia , secret installation might doomed . the forces stationed installation unable defend circumstances . their mighty naval ships ships bottle . they dare open bottle sail fight russian commandos armed tactical nuclear weapons . to open blast-proof entrance doors would suicide . on april 5 , two days south georgia island seized , 40 naval ships began moving british ports . the day lord carrington sacked foreign minister . he forced resign , friends , assisted rockefeller attack plan downplaying argentine attack preparations . that day , april 5 , new zealand , home secret naval fleet , broke diplomatic relations argentina . the two hidden new zealand facilities placed `` red alert . '' as precautionary measure , submarines twin base ordered sea . several surface ships already sea undergoing `` sea trials '' , still left seven ( 7 ) major ships inside hidden twin naval base including one nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier . on busy day april 5 , argentina 's foreign minister , costa mendez , united nations new york . he alarmed deployment large part royal navy . costa mendez hurried washington seek reassurances certain officials . he got ! for next two weeks news filled stories allegedly slow movement british fleet negotiations went . that , friends , cover story . the royal navy actually joining moving rapidly possible toward south georgia island . if task force arrived time save secret base , major battle likely . the official stories `` slow movement '' british armada intended give cushion time battle . if need , fleet would several days retake south georgia island , could move arrive near falklands announced schedule . in way crucial importance south georgia island would hidden big secret preserved . it initially expected advance elements british fleet would reach vicinity south georgia island within two weeks . that would soon enough attack joint rockefeller-russian commando team stop drilling completed . but russian cosmospheres submarines made shambles plan . key advance elements south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14 , two days announced officially . shortly , ran trouble . russian cosmospheres attack submarines closed single ship critical planned counterassault south georgia island . the cosmospheres bombarded bridge combat information center ship neutron radiation . in moments ship without command , communications radar silenced . then russian `` sub '' closed quickly finished key british ship torpedoes . it broke apart secondary explosions sank rapidly . so far known , survivors . this unexpected shock mid-atlantic produced two results , important : first , caused slowdown race toward south atlantic british armada . the task force regrouped configuration better suited enroute defense , cost valuable time . public announcements london progress fleet reflected slowdown . the timetable arrival battle stations near falklands started stretching longer longer . all bought extra time joint commando team south georgia island . the drilling continued . the result sinking equally important . word flashed south pacific stealth navy prepare possible action . it obvious russian navy getting involved atlantic , meant royal navy could big trouble . during dead night , early april 15 , seven stealth ships put sea twin secret bases southern new zealand . they deployed secret operational headquarters area antipodes islands , 450 miles southeast new zealand . their electromagnetic shields operating provide protection attack . these shields make impossible communicate outside world even see , i explained last month ; arrived antipodes , stealth ships hooked buoys equipped shielded communication cables island headquarters . the antipodes headquarters , turn , constant touch south georgia base way transoceanic cable around tip south america . the deployment available ships south pacific stealth fleet exactly joint rockefeller-russian planners hoped . the ships flushed essentially invulnerable hiding place new zealand ! the british ship 's sinking april 14 also followed events . on april 15 argentine navy started moving port . the day , alexander haig arrived buenos aires . supposedly diplomat , reality general , dealing generals . haig top governmental operative rockefeller cartel , i revealed past . he making sure argentines get cold feet back critical moment . four days later , april 19 , haig left washington . as boarded plane , haig somberly told reporters , `` time running .

( laughter . ) the president : i 'll give answer , i 'll give yeltsin 's answer . ( laughter . ) q the first meeting presidents , money 's promised government money , naturally 's going distributed government . but 've indicated three-quarters going going businesses . so question russian businesses going consulted , ever ? what priorities , several association russian businessmen existing already , invited participate setting priorities investment ? this first . and second , . we know polls , public polls america show americans enthusiastic giving aid . like newsweek polls say 75 percent n't approve , new york times published 52 percent support prevents civil war ; 42 percent fosters democratic reform ; 29 percent personally supports yeltsin . how going sort handle problem americans enthusiastic ? thank . q i question , i 'm sorry -- going translation everything russian ? no , answers . just answers . okay . the president : the answer first question , depends kind aid 're discussing . for example , funds set financing new businesses obviously go businesses apply seem good risks make application . the privatization fund used support privatization existing public enterprises . then general funds democracy corps things people russia influence distribution . with regard second question , let say i would think would people countries would feel warmly toward simply american government giving money russian government . there 's opposition russia . and country , throughout whole history opposition foreign aid kinds . that , nothing russia . if look whole history america , kind aid program always unpopular . what i tried tell american people , aid program , investment program ; investment future . we spent $ 4 trillion -- trillion -- armaments soldiers investments cold war . now , democratic government russia , newly independent states , remainder working democracy struggling get economies going , seems much interest make possible whatever democracy survive , economy russia grow potential trade investment , us continue effort reduce nuclear weapons elements hostility sides , side russian side . so i n't see aid program ; investment united states . this much interest united states . the things i announced today , second stage program , i hope put together next week , view things good country taxpayers workers country . russia great nation needs partnership , common endeavor people share goals . but would great mistake anyone view sort charity aid issue . that 's , 's investment america 's wonderful investment . like investments , risk . but 's far less risk far greater potential return $ 4 trillion spent looking across barrier cold war . q mr. president , first thank much , indeed , coming talking us . in memory living correspondents , first time american president russian press corps , 's kind measured breakthrough . i two questions . one , introductory remarks press conference , mentioned brief discussed start ii start i issues . could tell us : did reach agreement president yeltsin might done order ukraine join ratification start i npt regime ? and second question , confident united states congress would eager support lifting jackson-vanik restrictions inherited cold war ? president clinton : first , discussed issue ukraine regard start i npt , generally , regard need proceed independent states non-nuclear ; also united states develop strong relationships . we know one thing could would increase , i think , willingness ukraine support direction successfully conclude negotiations highly enriched uranium , would provide important economic opportunity russia , also ukraine , would show reaching part . but agreed basically people signed lisbon protocol got honor , agreed continue press . i , , spent good deal time trying reassure ukraine 's leaders , specifically president foreign minister , i want strong ties ukraine , united states much wants good relationship ukraine , , order need together strengthen economy ukraine united states fully supportive , commitment ratify start i join npt regime critical . what second question ? the president : with regard jackson-vanik cocom , i would make two points : first , i agreed republican democratic leaders congress , soon i return , list legislative restrictions , regulatory nature , imposed relations united states russia , legacies cold war . and see whether 're -- many could agree away right , least among leadership congress . with regard jackson-vanik , i think openness change law congress convinced , fact , refusniks , people wish emigrate allowed . if fact one would -- law designed affect , i think desire keep law much less . with regard cocom , guess , 's nothing guess , leadership congress indeed advisers , might prefer see sort phased movement cocom regime . but i think would willing begin fairly near future . q mr. clinton , i read speech annapolis , i got impression completely different personal -- i stress -- personal , political approach towards russia , compared approach mr. bush . could formulate words , difference personality approach -- difference approach russia approach mr. bush ? and made -- cite akhmatova last part speech ? the president : let say , first , i wish compare president bush anyone else . i ca n't say heart russia . i say since i boy , i personally fascinated history , music culture , literature russia . i thrilled russian music since i serious student music 30 years . i read major russian novelists many poets followed ballet tried know much i could history . and i went soviet union -- soviet union -- may know big issue last presidential campaign i spent first week 1970 alone moscow return three days mr. yeltsin elected president . but time i away , i following events closely hoping day could genuine partners . so i always personal feeling russia . i remember , example -- lot know i like music much . one moving experiences musician leonard bernstein took new york philharmonic moscow played shostakovich 's fifth symphony russians . and played last movement rapidly anyone ever played technically difficult . that something i followed closely occurred . these things always big impact life . and i always hoped someday , i ever chance , i could play role seeing two countries become closer partners .

years age -- selected states , 1988 1989 ====================================================== source : mmwr 42 ( 14 ) date : apr 16 , 1993 motor-vehicle crashes leading cause death among children young adults united states account 1 million years potential life lost age 65 annually ( 1 ) . child safety seats safety belts substantially reduce loss ( 2 ) . from 1977 1985 , 50 states passed legislation requiring use child safety seats safety belts children . although laws reduce injuries young children estimated 8 % -59 % ( 3,4 ) , motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain major cause disability death among u.s. children ( 1 ) , use occupant restraints among children decreases inversely age ( 84 % usage aged 0-4 years ; 57 % , aged 5-11 years ; 29 % , aged 12-18 years ) ( 5 ) . in addition , parents use safety belts less likely use restraints children ( 6 ) . to characterize association adult safety-belt use adult-reported consistent use occupant restraints youngest child aged less 11 years within household , cdc analyzed data obtained behavioral risk factor surveillance system ( brfss ) 1988 1989 . this report summarizes findings study . data available 20,905 respondents

safety-belt law ( i.e. , vehicles could stopped safety-belt law violation alone ) . in nine states , child-passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 laws included children aged less 5 years , two states used age size child criteria mandatory restraint use . the analysis report subgrouped states 1 ) law requiring adult safety-belt use ( law states ) , 2 ) without law ( no-law states ) . overall , 21 % children aged less 11 years reportedly consistently restrained automobile travel . both child restraint use adult restraint use significantly higher ( p less 0.05 , chi-square test ) law states no-law states ( 81.1 % versus 74.3 % 58.7 % versus 43.2 % , respectively ) . high rates restraint use children aged less equal 1 year reported adults indicating consistent less consistent safety-belt use ( figure 1 ) . adults consistent use reported high rates child-occupant restraint use regardless child 's age ( range : 95.5 % 1-year-olds 84.7 % 10-year-olds ) . in comparison , adults reporting less consistent safety-belt use , rate child- occupant restraint use declined sharply age child ( range : 93.1 % 1-year-olds 28.8 % 10-year-olds ) . when comparing children consistent adult safety-belt users children less consistent adult safety-belt users , 95 % confidence intervals overlap two youngest age groups ( i.e. , aged less 1 1 year ) . reported child-occupant restraint use law states generally exceeded no-law states , regardless age child ( table 1 ) . in addition , higher adult educational attainment significantly associated increased restraint use children , factor also associated increased adult safety-belt use ( 8 ) . reported : national center injury prevention control ; national center chronic disease prevention health promotion , cdc . editorial note : the findings report consistent others indicating adults use safety belts less likely employ occupant restraints children ( 6,9 ) . because nonbelted adults increased risk crashing likely exhibit risk-taking behaviors , children traveling may greater risk motor-vehicle injury ( 10 ) . educational attainment adult respondents inversely associated child restraint use report . accordingly , occupant-protection programs promoted among parents low educational attainment . because low educational attainment often associated low socioeconomic status , programs offered adults health-care facilities serve low-income communities federal programs ( i.e. , head start ) directed parents young children . injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children . in addition , however , efforts must intensified protect child occupants hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6 , number 10 april 20 , 1993 become older . parents , especially low educational attainment , consistently wear safety belts , states mandatory safety-belt use laws , encouraged wear safety belts protect children using approved child safety

-- headquarters chamber commerce support effort chamber making , along center work force preparation , help examine tonight whole critical question move young people school work place . i want compliment chamber efforts , recognizing without educated work force ca n't grow economy remain competitive , recognizing work together -- business government , labor educators -- make things happen . this satellite town meeting good example kind working together . and 'll forgive little home state pride , i want say special word thanks wal-mart corporation , headquartered bentonville , arkansas , providing several hundred sites town meeting tonight . i appreciate lot , well sites provided rest . i tried hard i could move toward constructive change country . secretary riley talked thomas jefferson 's 250th birthday . if thomas jefferson believed anything , believed three things : first , education ; second , real personal liberty , freedom religion , freedom speech , freedom association , freedom press ; third , absolute imperative changing times change . if go jefferson memorial beautiful city , bedecked wonderful cherry blossoms , see jefferson saying change changing times . for us america , means reducing deficit increasing investment putting people first compete world . we 're talk tonight -- educate train people better . unless , none efforts rest us make government , even bring budget balance , even increase investment things grow jobs , last long run . we also people carry load . and world average young person change jobs seven eight times lifetime , begins education system continues work force education must go lifetime . it 's important know , learn . and i might , i 'd like close emphasizing 're best try innovative partnership labor department education department private sector build good school-to-work transition . and 're trying get good start summer program would create 700,000 new summer jobs , including many thousands strong education component young people learning working time . dick , i think i ought stop . that 's good place begin , i think , discussion . secretary riley : thank much , mr. president . each month get together talk ways citizens work towards reaching national education goals . and tonight , 'll focus goal five , communities prepare students world work . this week , education department labor department hosting conference washington , d.c. called summer challenge , program work learning , america 's youth . the aim use special funds president clinton 's proposed economic stimulus package provide educationally-enriched jobs summer school programs young people disadvantaged areas country . mr. president , let 's talk minute -- alluded somewhat -- summer youth challenge . your program calls educational enrichment summer jobs . and words important ? the president : i think 's important two reasons . first , lot young people 're trying reach may trouble adjusting school learning . and want good experience real job , also want continue learn summer know lot research lot kids trouble learning school may forget much 30 percent learned previous year summertime . and unproductive thing schools take lot time teaching already taught . secondly , want help young people progress , terms work , terms learning . we want abolish artificial dividing line work learning think best productive workers lifetime learners . and think experience could maybe drive point home prepare young people succeed school , work , college go . secretary riley : well , i think fact disadvantaged kids -- gap , lag mentioned go next year , really even greater . secretary reich , course , training programs throughout year . and i wonder comment educational component training . secretary reich : well , 've learned , mr. secretary , many young people , whether 's summer year , actually on-the-job work experience combined education one best ways learning . many young people , example , lot -- difficult time learning geometry . but actually building something working something , see exact direct application geometry , understand 's used . and lot young people -- sense connection education world work terribly , terribly important . it 's important summer , 's important lot young people even beyond summer . secretary riley : thank . mr. president , 've called youth apprenticeship program , school-to-work transition . and i wonder would tell us little bit concept see developing . the president : well , first , let 's talk 's important . most new jobs created decade require four-year college degree , require learning skills go well beyond people get high school diploma . if look last 10 years , average salaries young people least two years good post-high school education good salary went decade . the young people less tended lower wages go , many cases real terms fell decade , n't productive , n't valuable employers . so think america big economic interest trying ensure young people get high school n't go college make transition work , includes two years training either community college , vocational setting , perhaps job . and i done budget , know , give secretary reich funds incentives try work partnership states private sector build programs state-by-state way would customized essentially business community , based needs economy given area . it could revolutionize long-term quality american work force earnings american workers . secretary reich : i add , mr. president -- i think know experience arkansas -- many people watching program -- business community educators , labor groups already many communities , many states , building school-to-work transition program . in fact , 's awful lot ferment , lot excitement . the people watching program probably ones directly involved . and power . secretary riley i going everything build successes already . secretary riley : bob , 're going talking tonight youth apprenticeship tech prep , co-op learning career academies . and features programs deal subject -- features every one school-to-work programs might important ? secretary reich : well , one thing 've seen -- i working long time , much longer i -- 've seen active involvement business community absolutely essential . and i 'm delighted 're headquarters chamber commerce . the chamber commerce united states committed kinds programs -- training , education , retraining -- 've aimed work closely chamber . the business community going actively engaged developing almost audit kind jobs needed helping educators , community colleges , technical institutions develop curricula relevant jobs future . communities got come together . i mean , one important things . you 've got players community come together work together cooperate together . you know , often educators business leaders , labor groups everybody talking , 're really working together common strategy . and third final ingredient i would say , dick , would commitment excellence -- commitment academic excellence also skills development excellence . this tracking program 're talking kids going make . this program every young person ought eligible . if want go beyond four-year college , 's fine . that ought permissible . but 're talking foundation learning jobs , foundation skills on-the-job learning . and , critical components . it 's already done . the president : i think -- i might interject one point based personal experience home -- business community critical role play , simply saying job skills needed 's ought taught , also monitoring excellence . if right sort partnership , people paying taxes going hiring workers going permit second-rate programs survive way shape influence . so i think 's important . and try , , fill blanks federal level , trying set standards provide funds , one things want sure make sure employer heavy amount influence quality programs , 's really 's going determine whether whole thing worthwhile . secretary riley : that 's great . we 've talking , course , school-to-work also jobs economic recovery program summer fall . but let 's talk moment long-term school reform . it 's something especially close . mr. president , i wonder would give us ideas communities goals 2000 legislation i think coming forth long . the president : well , know , back i governors , spent lot time working public schools tried candid people saying lot things going take time materialize . i hand writing national education goals governors drafted , along representatives president bush 's administration back 1989 . and 're going try year leadership introduce legislation congress actually define things national government ought try help local schools children country adult learners , , meet goals -- making sure -- 2000 , people show school ready learn ; get 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate ; children 4th , 8th , 12th grades confident subjects 're supposed know ; second none math science ; schools safe , disciplined , drug-free . and , course , fifth goal -- i took line say last -- system life-long learning country . and one goals 's national role , state role , school role , school district role , private sector role . and 've attempted bill 're going introduce next weeks define job ; give rest america way defining job seeing whether 're actually meeting standards quality need meet . it 's exciting . so far i know , nothing quite like ever done form federal legislation . not mandating telling people money , actually setting framework excellence partnerships job . i 'm really excited . secretary riley : well , i , . and i think really entirely new role federal government terms relationship states , serving partner really support facilitate help education reform efforts , driven high standards . that 's point . bob , let ask one question , 'll get telephone calls . it 's subject . we , course , skills standards going part goals 2000 , i wonder would comment . secretary reich : well , know , 75 percent young people n't graduate college . very often n't many alternatives . they wonderful system community colleges technical institutions , national skill standards could aspire employers would understand national credential , many young people would actually find much eligible jobs . everybody n't go college . other countries smaller proportions population going college , whole level people certain technical , preprofessional skills . we country . if n't go four-year college 're loser . and want develop national skill standards . we 're going working states , education department , lot private industry developing standards . and i think kinds things enable vocational technical institutions rally around , well business community . secretary riley : well , 's great . why n't go ahead go telephone . we call , i see -- mayor bruce todd austin , texas . q yes , mr. president mr. secretary reich riley , certainly appreciate opportunity join today . we dedicated professionals volunteers austin heard said appreciative . let simply say , amen comments made already . we agree much tone clinton administration taken , supportive . we successful austin tripling summer employment program last four years . we expect 2,000 employed year summertime ; perhaps much 3,500 federal assistance . much question designed answered opening comments , must thinking alike . but question essentially involved initiatives labor day would appropriate . we know summertime important . year-round even important . and kind initiatives federal level might proposed meet needs youth year- round basis ? and perhaps importantly , families local community involved using federal initiative ? that 's something believe important success effort . secretary riley : mr. president . the president : i think i 'll give everybody chance answer question , bruce , let first thank calling , thank great work 're austin . i 've seen i 've always impressed . first , regard summer program , hope structure way enable us continue summer program move lot young people back schools circumstances might allow work private sector , . we hope -- secretary reich going try set system create lot private sector jobs matched public sector jobs summer . and 're working . secondly , program i presented congress next five years , attempting build amount investment 's quite substantial job training programs , school-to-work programs , give heavy , heavy weight local community input -- question asked -- provide federal investment dollars , hope put local dollars keep people working trained year-round basis . and i say , echo secretary reich said moment ago , try break barrier seen work seen learning . an awful lot young people actually quite high iqs , actually learn much better 're 're reading listening . so hope community involvement part permanent , hope whole budget passes -- 200 budget cuts 200 , actually , budget -- revenue raisers , new money education training , 'll able seem want based question . bob , want say anything ? secretary reich : well , took words mouth , mr. president , usual . but let add one thing , one important aspects post-high school lot young people going college , addition school-to-work program , simply availability jobs . and 've got get economy moving , obviously . it 's terribly important get recovery program , get economy back track . that 's sort prerequisite everything else . if n't get economy back track -- -- i think 16th -- correct i 'm wrong , mr. president -- i think 16th month seven percent unemployment greater . this jobless recovery . a lot kids going getting school june . and even everything right , would , hard time getting jobs . secretary riley : thank . of course , goals 2000 permanent , long-term thing certainly

parent involvement . and i think everybody see great energy , get moving . the next call dr. harry heinemann , new york . doctor ? q good evening , mr. secretary . it pleasure evening . as may know , bridging school work central la guardia 's educational program since inception 1970s , includes college , two alternative high schools operate campus , linkages forged local schools . we found extremely effective learning strategy . and years , 've come believe several principles important bridging school work . and include integrating theory classroom practice workplace , providing students early exposure careers , well providing opportunities reflect upon experiences strengthen skills ; lastly , critical role liberal arts , particularly development high performance competencies . my question , : how general education faculty academic curriculum closely integrated transition work experience ? and mechanisms strategies suggest achieve integration ? secretary riley : well ,

care comment -- comments might ? the president : i 'd like say , i might , one thing . i want reemphasize i n't think i 'm clear i 'd like , although i think least one people second panel able say explicitly i. i think whole concept applied academics important . and i think basically abolish i consider artificial distinction vocational learning academic learning . i think keep liberal arts going . i think strong component people vocational program . secretary reich : it seems also need rethink entire tracking system , lot school work combinations important mainstream students . they 're important students . it 's special group students needs . some experiments i 've seen around united states -- dick , i 'm sure 've seen well -- mainstream experiments . they 're mainstreaming students . at 11th 12th grades 're giving combined work school experience transition program . and , kids either go college want ; go technical community ; go entirely -- large variety possibilities career directions . but get away stigmatizing often goes young people simply job-related work- related work within classroom , within schools . secretary riley : thank , much . i think 's going last call
